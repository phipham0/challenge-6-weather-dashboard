# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is a webpage that is displaying a weather dashboard. It was a project built using a third party api (openWeather), localStorage, data attributes, and other important fundamentals of a website.
The webpage features a static header, dynamic icons and text based on the city that is chosen, a current day weather display, a forecast of the next 5 days, and a history of searched cities.

This project was pretty fair and a little difficult. I think the project really challenged me to put everything I've learned so far into one webpage. I think I am finally getting the hang of local storage and 
DOM traversal.

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository onto your PC.
Enter the directory that has the cloned repository and open (Double click) the index.html, style.css and script.js files to read the code and access the files.

## Usage

There is a static header at the topic labeled Weather Dashboard. On the left side is a search form where the user can type in the name of a city like "Houston", or "Atlanta." Clicking submit after typing in a city
will display that city's weather for the day and its next 5 days, showing temperature, wind, and humidity. Also, a history of the cities search will display under the search form. This history is stored in the 
web browsers local storage and will stay unless cleared, regardless of refreshes.
